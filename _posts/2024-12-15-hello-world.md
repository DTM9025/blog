title:  "Hello World!"

Hello everyone! Welcome to the first post of my blog! I'm pretty excited to be launching this as another platform dedicated to whatever ramblings I have going on in my head. Here you will find my thoughts on various video game/media topics, not just about Fire Emblem, but other series that I'm interested in as well. This is something I've been thinking about doing for a while and I'm happy to finally start it!

## Why a Blog?

Now I do have various platforms, like my YouTube channel and my Twitter. However, those honestly I feel pretty restricted in the sort of posts I can make. For YouTube, that site really punishes you if you stray outside your "niche", which in my case is Fire Emblem Heroes. While I am pretty happy with how the mystery podcast was recieved, I would be lying if I were to say it didn't harm my views in the algorithm. That doesn't mean I'll stop doing them as I really want to continue that and it is great talking with Zeez about mystery games, but the point that there is this soft-restriction still stands. Plus, sometimes I just want to type things and not make a video about it.

As for Twitter, well even discounting the character limit, I feel like Twitter is just not a great place for the sort of in-depth write-ups that I want to do. Most of my followers there are following me just for FEH stuff and personally I think a blog that is easily linkable/navigatable and has this structure would be better. Plus, Twitter has been growing more and more into a cesspool in the past two years containing literally the worst people ever and personally I've been reducing my usage of Twitter as of late. I think it's just good to have another platform that I control and not beholden to some algorithm.

## What to Expect

So yeah, this is the blog. Obviously you can expect more in-depth (or at the very least, long) write-ups on various topics whenever I want. These will mainly be focused on various video games series that I'm a fan of, but it could also be other media as well, like anime, manhwa, TV shows, movies, etc. I'm just a person with a lot of thoughts in my head and sometimes I have the desire to share them and I hope you all will enjoy my musings.

For instance, there's been a lot of things about mystery games that I would love to discuss without it being podcast or video form. Things about like specific cases or themes or singular scenes, etc. that would be too particular for a video on my channel. There's also somethings about Fire Emblem in general that I would love to share, like why I love the Future Past DLC in Awakening so much. You can expect to see that sort of thing here!

Don't expect any sort of schedule or anything like that. I'll just be posting whenever I want and that could take from days to maybe even over a year between posts. I do recognize that this may make it a bit difficult to follow, but mainly I just want a place that I can write things whenever I feel like it.

One thing I will say is that this will not have any IRL topics, whether regarding myself or anything else happening in the world. I do want to keep that separation and not get too parasocial. I do appreciate your understanding.

## Look Forward to Future Posts!
